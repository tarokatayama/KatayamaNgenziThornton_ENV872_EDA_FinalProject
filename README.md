Final Project
Precipitation change for 3 campuses: Duke, UNC Wilmington, App State

Analysis plan:
1) increase over time<- seasonal Kendall-Mann test. Use geom_smooth to see if there is an increase in precip over time. 
2) increase comparing decades<- t-test comparing decades, and seeing if there is significant difference between time periods.
