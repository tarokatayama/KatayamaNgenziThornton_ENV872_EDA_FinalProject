Final Project
Precipitation change for 3 campuses: Duke, UNC Wilmington, App State

Analysis plan:
1) increase over time<- seasonal Kendall-Mann test. Use geom_smooth to see if there is an increase in precip over time. 
2) increase comparing decades<- t-test comparing decades, and seeing if there is significant difference between time periods.
3) we can see if there is an increase in number of 'significant' storms recently.
3) Mapview of spatial location of our project
